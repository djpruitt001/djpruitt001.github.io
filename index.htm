<h4>Sidenotes:</h4>
<p>If the dough is too sticky, <em>don't panic!</em> Lather your hands in flour and roll them into balls, it'll be fine! 
    Make sure that each cookie has enough room for it to expand withouttouching the others.
     If you have too many on one pan, it may turn into a cookie cake! </p>
