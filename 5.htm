<h1>The Truth About These Cute, but Scary Animals</h1>
<p>Not many Americans think about Kangaroos on the regular, mostly because we see them in Zoos and no where else.
    Australians surely don't see Kangaroos just wandering the highways each day, but I'm sure they come across them more 
    than we do. I've compiled a list of reasons why I think Kanagroos are scary, yet cute.
</p>
<h5>Cute because:</h5>
<ol>
    <li>Their noses. So cute, 10/10 would boop. </li>
    <li>As Joeys, they're so adorable! Tiny killing machines if you will.</li>
    <li>They honestly remind me of a passive agressive Tigger from Winnie the Pooh</li>
    <li>Their little stretches make me want to cry because it's so cute.</li>
    <li>Their doe like eyes could get anything from me</li>
</ol>
<h5>Scary because:</h5>
<ul> 
   <li>They can kill you... but you've been killed by a cute animal so what's the issue?</li>
   <li>When provoked they will rock your ish, fists will be flying.</li>
   <li>Kangaroos never miss a gym day, they are SWOLE.</li>
   <li>The amount of muscle this animal has is mind blowing, you can see it. THEY AREN'T EVEN FLEXING.</li>
</ul>
