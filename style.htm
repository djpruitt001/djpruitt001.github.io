<h1>Things You Might Wanna Take To The Beach</h1>
<p>Nearly everytime someone plans a trip to the beach, they forget something fairly important.
    Or at least, something that inconvenices them. Sometimes it's your camera, sometimes its your 
    underwear, whatever it may be!
    I'm here to help you make sure every single thing is packed!

  <p>You may want to pack other things depending on the location and the time of year. 
      You may pack things like diapers and wet wipes, or even female products depending on who is on the trip.
      I've covered the most basic things that you should not forget on your trip,
      but make sure you think of everyone when you pack. 
      <span><b>Making a list a week in advance and adding to it as you go is always a good idea!</b></span>
